GRAnular Materials: Mechanics & phYsics (GRAMMY)
======

My name is Teng Man. I am currently a lecturer and a research associate at the College of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT). Prior to this position, I was a research fellow working at the School of Engineering, Westlake University. At Westlake University, I spent more than five years working with [Prof. Sergio A. Galindo-Torres](https://m3.westlake.edu.cn/) to investigate the physics and mechanics of granular materials and help advise Ph.D. students. 

My interest in granular materials started after I started my Ph.D. program working with [Prof. Kimberly Hill](https://cse.umn.edu/cege/hill-kimberly) and [Prof. Jia-Liang Le](https://cse.umn.edu/cege/le-jia-liang) to investigate the gyratory compaction of asphalt mixtures. When asphalt mixtures are at a high temperature, the asphalt binder is at liquid state. Then, the asphalt mixture can be seen as a mixture of granular materials and viscous liquid. The study of asphalt mixture compaction became granular physics related, which encouraged me to explore more on the mechanics and physics of granular system in general.
