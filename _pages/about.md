My name is Teng Man. I am currently a lecturer and a research associate at the College of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT). Prior to this position, I was a research fellow working at the School of Engineering, Westlake University. At Westlake University, I spent more than five years working with [Prof. Sergio A. Galindo-Torres](https://m3.westlake.edu.cn/) to investigate the physics and mechanics of granular materials and help advise Ph.D. students. 

My interest in granular materials started after I started my Ph.D. program working with Prof. Kimberly Hill and Prof. Jia-Liang Le to study the gyratory compaction of asphalt mixtures. When asphalt mixtures are at a high temperature (usually when \\(\Theta > 100^{\circ}\\)C), the asphalt binder is at liquid state. Then, the asphalt mixture can be seen as a mixture of granular materials and viscous liquid. The study of asphalt mixture compaction became granular physics related.
